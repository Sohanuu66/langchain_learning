Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview

Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
These tasks include reasoning, learning, perception, and natural language understanding.

AI can be broadly categorized into two types:
1. Narrow AI: Designed for specific tasks such as image recognition, recommendation systems, or voice assistants.
2. General AI: A theoretical concept where machines possess human-like cognitive abilities to perform any intellectual task.

Applications of AI span across various fields such as:
- Healthcare: Disease prediction, diagnostic assistance, and drug discovery.
- Education: Personalized learning and automated grading systems.
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles and traffic optimization.
- Finance: Fraud detection and risk assessment.

However, AI also presents ethical challenges including data privacy, job displacement, and algorithmic bias.
Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability remains a key focus in responsible AI development.
